A simple currency converter using exchange rates obtained via Quandl's free API.

I've used the Javascript Fetch API to retrieve several JSON files containing the exchange rate of the US dollar against a few other major currencies.

Although the most recent data provided by the free API is from December 2016, I had great fun doing this little personal project.

The app can also convert other currencies different than USD, such as GBP to EUR. To achieve this, it converts the GBP amount to USD and then the USD one to EUR.
